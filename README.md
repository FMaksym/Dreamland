   The project called "Fantasy Farm" is a game, the essence of which is to discover all the territories and buildings on an unusual island, which consists of several islands, with different seasons, connected to each other by paths and bridges. They must be opened to the player with the help of resources that are mined by various mines or resource processors.

   The game is a very simple version of the Dreamdale game. Here I have implemented only a small part of the mechanics from the original game. Such as: mines, processors, growing vegetables on beds, growing fruits on a tree, collecting various resources in inventory and spending them, etc. In this project, I used an extended NavMesh called NavMeshSurface, with its help the player moved on the ground and with it I almost didn't use colliders, because the obstacles were defined with the help of Layers. I tried to create a data save to a JSON file, but ran into saving problems. When you exit the game, all data will be lost.
