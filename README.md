   The project called "Fantasy Farm" is a game, the essence of which is to discover all the territories and buildings on an unusual island, which consists of several islands, with different seasons, connected to each other by paths and bridges. They must be opened to the player with the help of resources that are mined by various mines or resource processors.

   The game is a very simple version of the Dreamdale game. Here I have implemented only a small part of the mechanics from the original game. For example: mines, processing plants, growing vegetables on the beds, growing fruit on the tree, storing and consuming various resources, teleports. In this project, I used an extended NavMesh called NavMeshSurface, with its help the player moved on the ground and with it I almost didn't use colliders, because the obstacles were defined with the help of Layers.

</p>In this project I implemented saving data into JSON files. Data about inventory, islands and buildings is saved in separate files. The player's level is saved in PlayerPrefs.
   
   </p>In the folders(Assets/Build) you can find a ready-made build for testing the game, you need to follow the link and download the apk file. 
   
   </p>Game optimized for mobile(materials, meshes(Combine mesh), Occlusion culling, code).

</p>The result can be seen at the link in the video:
